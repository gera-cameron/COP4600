###Microkernel
- Protection state high for *small* part of OS
- Small part is Microkernel
- Only does a few things:
  - Multiplexing CPU
  - IPC
  - Interrupt handling

###Rest of OS - NOT KERNAL
- Process Management - Scheduling Policy
- Memory Management - Allocation, &c.
- File Systems
- Drivers - I/O
